    <h3><em>As of February 11, 2018</em></h3>

    <p>Welcome back, singers! Please keep the music from the previous semester; you will return it at a later date. Additionally, we will likely be singing at the Montauk club at some point this spring.</p>

    <p>If you have yet to pay your dues for the semester, please pay Rick at your earliest convenience. Dues are $160 ($30 of which goes toward member tickets for this semester's concert). You may purchase your music for an additional fee (to be announced).</p>
