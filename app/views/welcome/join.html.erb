		<h2>Become a Member</h2>

		<p>Park Slope Singers is always looking for enthusiastic singers! We accept new members at the beginning of every semester.</br> 
		</br>Regular rehearsals are on Monday evenings, and take place at the parish hall of St. Saviour's Church in Park Slope, Brooklyn. They begin promptly at 7:30 p.m. and last until about 10:00 p.m. Halfway through each rehearsal, we break for announcements and refreshments provided by the members.</br>
		</br>Additionally, there are two Saturday afternoon rehearsals a semester. As with most choruses, dress rehearsals are held in the venue where the concert is being given, and attendance at the dress rehearsal is mandatory in order to perform in the concert.</br>
		</br>Members will please observe the dress code for our concerts.</br>
		</br>If you think you might be interested in joining the Park Slope Singers, or if you simply want more information, please contact our president, Frank Bolton. The easiest way to do this is to send an email using the form below.</br>
