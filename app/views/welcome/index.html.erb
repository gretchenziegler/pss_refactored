		<h3>Spring Concert: Vivaldi Plus Four</h3>

		<p>This May, the Park Slope Singers will be presenting a program of bold emotional music, culminating in Vivaldi's <em>Gloria</em>, an exuberant choral masterpiece. The other pieces include works by four 20th century composers, creating a beautiful blend of style and harmony.</p> 


		<p>George Dyson's <em>Four Songs for Sailors</em> is a dynamic & melodic suite which begins with <em>To the Thames</em>, while melodies from Anton Borodin's <em>Polyvetzian Dances</em> were used for the Tony Award winning 1953 Broadway musical <em>Kismet</em>. In addition, we will sing a selection from Morton Lauridsen's <em>Chansons Des Roses</em> and Maurice Durufl√©'s <em>Quartre Motets</em>, which use the Latin texts of four Gregorian hymns and interweave their Gregorian melodies within modern tonal settings.</p>

		<p>This soaring musical program serves not only as our spring concert, but also as a vibrant send-off to Ira Spaulding, our conductor for the past seven seasons.</p>

		<p>There will be two performances of this program:</p>
		<ul class="info">
			<li><strong>May 30, 2015 @3pm at Church of the Good Shepherd</strong> (4th Avenue & 75th Street), Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, as part of the Arts on the Corner series.</li>
