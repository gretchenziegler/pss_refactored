    <h2>Our History</h2>

    <p>The organization that we now call the Park Slope Singers came into being in May of 1992 because of one woman who loved to sing, but couldn't find the perfect group in her neighborhood. She wanted to sing with friends and to have some input into the sort of music they sang.
    She became a noodge: first one friend, then another, then friends of friends, and finally some singers from other choruses. They started singing in different apartments, but soon recognized that they needed a larger space, as well as a real director and someone good at playing the piano.</p>

    <p>In the early days, they passed a hat at each session to pay the conductor for that evening. Some of them agreed to assume ongoing responsibilities over the summer and early fall, like finding a space to rent for rehearsals, and managing the financial tasks.</p>
